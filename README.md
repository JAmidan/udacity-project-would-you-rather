Project Submission from Jason Amidan

## Background

I started this project after completing the React course material.  I restarted the course after completing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Mobile Gaming from Full Sail University. While working on this course I started a rather large react project at work. This project provides analytics and simplified data access for developers using Azure Dev Ops.  I found that while working on this project I was oftentimes split between different styles of React-Redux.  This made it difficult to switch gears back and forth from my day work coding to this project at night.  I also discovered that CSS does not behave the way I remember.  It was quite painful to style this project. You will see that it is very simplistically styled. Even this simple styling took me considerable time. 

I did really appreciate the way the course was structured. I went through the material twice. 

Please I beg of you accept this project as is and let me be done with this course.  I have started a 3D Arts certificate program, I am mentoring a First Robotics team and I am about to change jobs.  It would be very helpfuly to be done with this course.
